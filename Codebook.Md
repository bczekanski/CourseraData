Combined2 is the data set with the means for each subject and activity. In Combined2 V1 is the subject number, and V1.1 is the activity.
To create combined2 I put all of the data sets together and then grouped by v1, and V1.1 and then summarized each using the mean.

Combined_stats has the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
I did this by summarizing the mean.
